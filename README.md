Notes:

- Please see ./lambda/nth_calculator for the algorithm (in algorithm.py) and the Lambda function (in app.py), both of which are written in Python 3.
- While the Lambda configuration is done in this repository, configuration for DynamoDB, API Gateway, IAM and Amplify (which is simply used to host the webpage) is done in the AWS Management Console.
